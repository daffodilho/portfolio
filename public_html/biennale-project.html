          <h2>Art direction</h2>
          <p>A red-orange hue and its shade, along with a tint and a shade of grey makes up this monochromatic color palette. The vibrant red-orange emphasizes certain parts of the design without being as overpowering as red. It is chosen for its strong association with creativity.</p>
          <p>The display font is GT Walsheim in a medium weight. The typeface has a symmetrical design and when used in a condensed style, creates rectangular shapes that is coherent with the shapes used in the design. GT Flexa Mono is naturally condensed and quite bold at a regular weight, which makes it legible and also why it is chosen.</p>

          <h2>Design process</h2>
          <p>We started by studying Ellen Lupton’s design principles and Chris Ashworth’s design qualities. We chose two principles and three qualities, and grouped images that matched the principles and qualities. This would give us a better idea of how to apply them in our design process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="list-wrapper"> 
          <h2>Design principles </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Creating spatial planes with graphic transparency</li>
            <li>2. Misaligning text to break structure  </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Design qualities </h2>
          <ul> 
            <li>1. Overlapping elements to develop narratives</li>
            <li>2. Off-grid arrangement for visual weight</li>
            <li>3. Placement of shapes to create tension</li>
          </ul>
        </div><img src="../img/image-grouping.png" alt="Picture of Image Grouping">
        <p class="caption">Final image grouping according to principle and quality</p>
        <p>We developed 3 lines of investigation by combining one principle with one quality. We then designed multiple posters for each line, experimenting with different typefaces, color, and image treatment.</p>

        <p>Once we finalized our art direction,  we started building the microsite. In smaller teams, we worked on content planning, user flow, wireframing, visual design, interaction design, and prototyping.</p><img src="#" alt="User Flow">

          <h2>Challenges and Reflection</h2>
          <p>The four-week time constraint presented a challenge to our team. All of us had different schedules, took other classes, and some also had part-time work. We approached this by having clear role delegations, while still being flexible in assisting other team members when necessary. We adopted a more agile approach, simultaneously carrying out planning, design, and prototyping phases. This allowed us to complete the project in time.</p>
          <p>Through this project I familiarized myself with Figma, applied various design principles, and learned to improve my work through image treatment, font pairings, and layout design. It also taught me about design thinking methodologies and collaborating with a team in a short time. </p>
