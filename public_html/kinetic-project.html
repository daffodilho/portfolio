In the planning phase, I conducted research, developed a storyboard, and established the art direction. In the animating phase, I created graphic assets and animated the text sentence by sentence.</p><h3>Research</h3><p>While brainstorming scenes, I explored projects on Youtube for inspiration. Here are two examples that inspired the overall vibe of my project.</p><img class="full-width" src="../img/kinetic-ref1.webp" alt="Scenes from Duongrafik's kinetic typography lyrics video on YouTube" width="1388" height="568"><p class="caption"><a href="https://youtu.be/WYpiQdY8xj0?si=bmwsPqwIzj2fAVjB" target="_blank">Kinetic Typography Lyrics Video by Duongrafik &#x2197</a></p><img class="full-width" src="../img/kinetic-ref2.webp" alt="Scenes from Maginpanic's animated lyrics on YouTube" width="1392" height="571"><p class="caption"><a href="https://youtu.be/aejbTf8Y0_0?si=YVERkBn9aIRlLRiv" target="_blank">Animated Lyrics by Maginpanic &#x2197</a></p><h3>Storyboard</h3><p>I created a rough storyboard as reference for designing each scene. Sketching on paper helped me visualize concepts and quickly experiment with ideas.</p><img class="full-width" src="../img/kinetic-storyboard.webp" alt="Storyboard sketch" width="2550" height="1980"><p class="caption">Storyboard</p><h3>Typography Selection</h3><p>I created a google doc to experiment with various typefaces.</p><img class="full-width" src="../img/kinetic-typographytest1.webp" alt="Testing the lyrics with various typefaces" width="1505" height="852"><img class="full-width" src="../img/kinetic-typographytest2.webp" alt="Testing the lyrics with various typefaces continued" width="1505" height="907"><p class="caption">Experimenting with different typefaces</p><h3>Animating</h3><p>I animated the video sentence by sentence, with each composition containing one or two sentences. All compositions were then compiled into a single main composition. The following image shows my main composition arrangement.</p><img class="full-width" src="../img/kinetic-workflow.webp" alt="Screenshot of workspace in after effects showing the main composition" width="1721" height="374"><p class="caption">Main composition in After Effects</p><h3>Theory Application</h3><p>In this project, I applied animation principles and camera transitions to enhance movement and fluidity.</p><p>To create the illusion of weight, I used the “squash and stretch” principle on the bouncing smiley face by adjusting its scale. I also applied the "arcs" principle to ensure a smooth, natural bounce by refining the position keyframes and incorporating ease-ins and ease-outs. Additionally, I fine-tuned the motion by adjusting individual keyframes in the graph editor for a more polished flow.</p><div class="img-wrapper"><img class="third" src="../img/kinetic-principle1.webp" alt="Smiley face scene" width="636" height="356"><img class="third" src="../img/kinetic-principle2.webp" alt="Smiley face squashed" width="633" height="354"><img class="third" src="../img/kinetic-principle3.webp" alt="Smiley face stretched" width="634" height="357"></div><p class="caption">Squash and stretch principle</p><img class="full-width" src="../img/kinetic-principle4.webp" alt="Arc paths for smiley face" width="687" height="319"><p class="caption">Arcs principle</p><p>I incorporated camera movements to create seamless transitions. For example, in this scene I used a combination of dolly out, pan, and truck. This was achieved by utilizing 3D layers, a null object, and adjusting the camera’s depth of field and aperture.</p><div class="img-wrapper"><img class="half" src="../img/kinetic-transition1.webp" alt="Smiley faces with the word EVERY on one face" width="474" height="264"><img class="half" src="../img/kinetic-transition2.webp" alt="Smiley faces with the word SMIL on one face and EVERY DAY I'M on another." width="474" height="265"></div><p class="caption">Transition using camera movements</p></section><section><h2>Challenges and Takeaways</h2><p>One of the main challenges I faced was determining how to transition smoothly between scenes. For instance, I struggled to find a fitting transition between these two scenes.</p><div class="img-wrapper"><img class="half" src="../img/kinetic-challenge1.webp" alt="Scene showing the lyrics WHAT COULD BE BETTER" width="1433" height="804"><img class="half" src="../img/kinetic-challenge2.webp" alt="Scene showing WHEN PARADISE FEELS SO RIGHT WITHOUT YOU" width="1434" height="799"></div><p class="caption">Lost in transition</p><img class="full-width" src="../img/kinetic-challenge3.webp" alt="Scene showing wave transition" width="1433" height="802"><p class="caption">Drafting on paper helped me develop the idea of a wave sweeping up as a transition.</p><p>Another challenge was ensuring the elements moved as intended while keeping timing in mind. For example, animating the walking crab involved rotating and positioning each leg individually, and the movement needed to be large enough to be visible, given the small size of the legs on screen.</p><img class="full-width" src="../img/kinetic-challenge4.webp" alt="Screenshot of workspace in after effects for crab leg animation" width="1920" height="1080"><p class="caption">Controlling the keyframes for animating crab legs</p><p>Despite these challenges, this project strengthened my understanding of animation principles. I gained hands-on experience using After Effects, particularly in working with 3D layers, camera movements, and keyframe adjustments. Moving forward, I plan to explore more complex animations and transitions, further refining both my technical and conceptual skills.</p></section><section id="other-projects"><div class="project-link"><h3>&#8592</h3><a href="biennale-project.html">Biennale Architettura</a></div><div class="project-link"><a class="align-right" href="east-project.html">East Side Games</a><h3>&#8594</h3></div></section></section></div></body></html>
