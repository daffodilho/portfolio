        <h2>Project objective</h2>
        <p>Develop a visual identity and design a microsite and two assets for the 17th Biennale Architettura Exhibition.</p>

        <h2>Design process</h2>
        <p>We studied and analyzed Ellen Lupton’s design principles and Chris Ashworth’s design qualities. Then, we created 3 lines of investigation by combining one principle with one quality.</p>

      <p>Lines of Investigation</p>
      <p>We grouped images based on our lines of investigation. This was used to guide our poster creation process for visualizing our art direction.</p><img src="#" alt="Image Grouping">

      <p>Next we designed and iterated on posters, incorporating the lines of investigation and using different typefaces, color, and image treatment.</p><img src="#" alt="Poster Iterations">

      <p>As our art direction takes shape, we experimented with the translation of each line to graphic assets.</p><img src="#" alt="Graphic Asset Iterations">

      <p>Once we finalized our art direction,  we started building the microsite. In smaller teams, we worked on content planning, user flow, wireframing, visual design, interaction design, and prototyping.</p><img src="#" alt="User Flow">

        <h2>Challenges and Reflection</h2>
        <p>The four-week time constraint presented a challenge to our team. We had 3 weeks to establish the art direction and complete the graphic assets, and 1 week to finish the microsite prototype. We approached this by having clear role delegations, while still being flexible in assisting other team members when necessary and giving timely feedback. We adopted a more agile approach, simultaneously carrying out planning, design, and prototyping phases.</p>
        <p>Through this project I familiarized myself with Figma, applied various design principles, and learned to improve my work through image treatment, font pairings, and layout design. It also taught me about design thinking methodologies and collaborating with a team in a short time. </p>
