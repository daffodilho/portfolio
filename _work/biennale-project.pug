                    p The monochromatic color palette consists of a red-orange hue, its shade, and two contrasting variations of gray. The vibrant red-orange draws attention without being as intense as red. It is also selected for its association with creativity and optimism, qualities that resonate with the exhibition's theme.
                    p The primary font, GT Walsheim, features a symmetrical design that, when condensed, forms rectangular shapes that complement the design's geometric elements. GT Flexa Mono, naturally condensed and bold at a regular weight, ensures legibility, making it an ideal choice.

                    h2 Design process
                    p We began by exploring Ellen Lupton’s design principles and Chris Ashworth’s design qualities, selecting two principles and three qualities to guide our approach. We then curated and grouped images that aligned with these concepts, providing a visual reference for integrating them into our design process.

                    h3 Three Lines of Investigation Posters
                    p We established three lines of investigation by pairing one design principle with one quality. For each, we created multiple poster variations, exploring different typefaces, color schemes, and image treatments. The final poster designs would define our art direction.

                    h3 Translation of Posters to Graphic Assets
                    p Once the posters were finalized, we explored how each line translated into graphic assets, testing their effectiveness and visual cohesion.

                    h3 Microsite creation
                    p After finalizing our art direction, we began developing the microsite prototype. Working in smaller teams, we focused on content planning, visual design and interaction design.

                    h2 Challenges and Takeaways
                    p The four-week time constraint posed a challenge for our team, as we balanced different schedules, coursework, and part-time jobs. To navigate this, we established clear role delegations while remaining flexible in supporting other roles. Adopting an agile approach, we ran planning, design, and prototyping phases in parallel, ensuring timely project completion.
                    p This project allowed me to familiarize myself with Figma, apply various design principles, and refine my work through image treatment, font pairings, and layout design. It also deepened my understanding of design thinking methodologies and enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively with a team under tight deadlines.
