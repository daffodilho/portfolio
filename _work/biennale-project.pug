                    p I chose a monochromatic color palette that consists of a red-orange hue, its shade, and two variations of gray. The vibrant red-orange draws attention without being as intense as red. It is also selected for its association with creativity and optimism, qualities that resonate with the exhibition's theme.
                    p The primary font, GT Walsheim, features a symmetrical design that, when condensed, forms rectangular shapes that complement the design's geometric elements. I paired it with GT Flexa Mono, which is naturally condensed and bold at a regular weight, ensuring legibility.

                    h2 Design process
                    p We began by exploring Ellen Lupton’s design principles and Chris Ashworth’s design qualities, selecting two principles and three qualities to guide our approach. We then curated and grouped images that aligned with these concepts, providing a visual reference for integrating them into our design process.

                    h3 Three Lines of Investigation Posters
                    p We designed multiple posters by experimenting with different pairs of principle + quality. I explored designing with different typefaces, color schemes, and image treatments. Then, we chose three of our best poster designs to translate into graphic assets.

                    h3 Translation of Posters to Graphic Assets
                    p Once the posters were finalized, we explored how each line translated into graphic assets, testing their effectiveness and visual cohesion.

                    h3 Microsite creation
                    p After finalizing our art direction, we began developing the microsite prototype. Working in smaller teams, we focused on content planning, visual design and interaction design. I mainly worked on the visual design of the website. I also assisted in creating the user flow and worked with the interaction design team to prototype our microsite.

                    h2 Challenges and Takeaways
                    p The four-week time constraint posed a challenge for our team, as we balanced different schedules, coursework, and part-time jobs. To navigate this, we established clear role delegations while remaining flexible in supporting other roles. Adopting an agile approach, we ran planning, design, and prototyping phases in parallel, ensuring timely project completion.
                    p This project allowed me to familiarize myself with Figma, apply various design principles, and refine my work through image treatment, font pairings, and layout design. It also deepened my understanding of design thinking methodologies and enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively with a team under tight deadlines.
